If you use zsh-test-runner in an open-source project, consider contributing a link to it.

## Software

- [`zsh-abbr`](https://github.com/olets/zsh-abbr) uses zsh-test-runner. Check out [its test suite](https://github.com/olets/zsh-abbr/tree/main/tests) for a real world example of one way of writing zsh-test-runner test suites.

## Demos

<!-- TODO update link: `next` becomes `main`  -->

- zsh-test-runner ships with [examples of how one might port ZUnit's and Bats's idioms to zsh-test-runner](https://github.com/olets/zsh-test-runner/tree/next/examples). These also serve as an example of multi-file test suites. (The examples do not aim to be fully comprehensive or to have full parity with ZUnit or Bats).
