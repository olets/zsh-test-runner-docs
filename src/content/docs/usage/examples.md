If you use zsh-test-runner in an open-source project, consider contributing a link to it.

## Software

- [`command-execution-timer`](https://command-execution-timer.olets.dev)'s [tests](https://github.com/olets/command-execution-timer/tree/main/tests) illustrate one way of using the queue.

- [`zsh-abbr`](https://zsh-abbr.olets.dev)'s [tests](https://github.com/olets/zsh-abbr/tree/main/tests) illustrate one way of splitting a suite into multiple files.

## Demos

<!-- TODO update link: `next` becomes `main`  -->

- zsh-test-runner ships with [examples of how one might port ZUnit's and Bats's idioms to zsh-test-runner](https://github.com/olets/zsh-test-runner/tree/next/examples). These also serve as an example of multi-file test suites. (The examples do not aim to be fully comprehensive or to have full parity with ZUnit or Bats).
