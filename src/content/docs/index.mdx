> Straight-forward tests and coverage reports for zsh and —under zsh's emulation— csh, ksh, and sh

**What it features**: everything you need for testing zsh scripts.

-   test [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) and, to a degree, [csh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell), [ksh](http://kornshell.com/), and [sh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) thanks to zsh's [`emulate`](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html) builtin
-   short and gentle learning curve
-   run one or more tests on the command line [^1]
-   run one or more tests saved in a test suite file [^2]
-   skip tests [^3]
-   optionally give tests descriptive names [^1] [^3]
-   optionally provide notes to tests (handy for listing dependencies in the logged output) [^1] [^3]
-   access cumulative failure, pass, and skip counts as shell variables [^1]
-   print coverage summaries with total count, failure count, pass count, skip count, failure rate, and pass rate [^4]

**What it does not feature**: its own human language-like declarative test syntax.

There's no "describe", "expect", etc. Downside is the tests don't read like a story. Upside is —because the shell already has rich support for tests— there is nothing idiomatic to learn, there are no artificial limits on what can be tested, the cost to migrating to zsh-test-runner (or from it, if you must) is very low, and there is no risk that assertions were incorrectly implemented. Just write your `[[ ]]`s, `(( ))`s, even your `test`s and `[ ]`s.
